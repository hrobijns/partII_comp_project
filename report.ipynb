    "By Newton's Law of Gravitation, the gravitational force experienced by particle $i$ (mass $m_i$, position $\\vec{r}_i$) due to a particle $j$ (mass $m_j$, position $\\vec{r}_j$) is given by:\n",

Note also that the force between two bodies diverges as they get close to each other: this requires the inclusion of a softening parameter $\\epsilon$ which will be discussed further in section X."
