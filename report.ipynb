    "By Newton's Law of Gravitation, the gravitational force experienced by particle $i$ (mass $m_i$, position $\\vec{r}_i$) due to a particle $j$ (mass $m_j$, position $\\vec{r}_j$) is given by:\n",

Note also that the force between two bodies diverges as they get close to each other: this requires the inclusion of a softening parameter $\\epsilon$ which will be discussed further in section X. Once the net force and therefore acceleration on each body has been calculated, its position and velocity can be updated through integration."

    "### *1.2 Barnes-Hut Algorithm, $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$*  \n",
    "The Barnes-Hut Algorithm attempts to reduce complexity by treating distant clusters of bodies as a single mass. It does this through the use of tree data structures, specifically an octree in 3D [CITE]. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.1 Tree construction\n",
    "Beginning with a topmost node that represents the whole simulation space, an octree is formed by subdividing the space into 8 octants recursively until each body lies in its own leaf node, a node with no children (see Figure 2). Each node, both internal and leaf nodes, contains information about the total mass and centre of mass position of the node. Formally, they are constructed by inserting bodies into the data structure one after the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if the node into which the body is being placed is an empty leaf node, the body is simply placed there and the total mass and centre of mass position of the node are trivially updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if the node is an internal node (i.e. a node with children), the total mass and centre of mass position of the node are updated, and the body moves down a level in the tree to the appropriate octant. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. if the node is a leaf node which already contains a body, the total mass and centre of mass position of the node is updated, and the node is subdivided into 8 octants. Then, both bodies are placed into their appropriate octants as above, which may require further subdivision if they end up in the same octant again.   \n"

    "##### 1.2.2 Force calculation\n",
    "To calculate forces, the tree is recursively traversed from the root for each body:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the node is a leaf node and contains a body that is not itself, then the force is calculated in the usual way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the node is an internal node, the ratio: $$\\frac{\\text{size of node in space (i.e. side length of the cube)}}{\\text{distance from body to centre of mass of node}} \\equiv \\frac{s}{d} $$ is calculated. If this is less than a threshold value $\\theta$ (usually taken to be $\\sim$ 1), then the node is seen to contain bodies that are closely packed and far away, and as a result can be treated as one single body, ignoring its children nodes. The force on the body is calculated in the usual way, using the centre of mass position and total mass of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If $s/d > \\theta$, the process recursively continues for each of the children of the node, until reaching the leaf node or a node which satisfies the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forces are then summed to give an overall acceleration for the body, allowing positions and velocities to be updated through integration as in the the naïve approach. It is clear to see that $\\theta$ determines the accuracy of the simulation: a larger $\\theta$ leads to fewer calculations but a more approximate solution, whilst a smaller $\\theta$ may take longer but provide a more reliable solution. In the limit $\\theta\\rightarrow0$ the algorithm reduces to the brute-force approach, since no internal nodes are treated as single bodies.\n",

    "For a _balanced_ octree with $h$ levels, the bottom level has $8^h$ nodes. Therefore:\n",

    "Insertion of each of the $N$ bodies requires travelling the $h$ levels of the tree from root to leaf, therefore the overall complexity of constructing an octree is given by $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$. "
