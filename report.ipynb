    "### **Introduction:**\n",
    "The analysis of many-body systems is highly relevant to many fields, from celestial bodies interracting gravitationally, to vortex methods in computational fluid dynamics, and more. These systems are complex to simulate: for three or more bodies the system becomes chaotic and extremely difficult to approach analytically without major simplifications, and naïvely calculating pairwise interractions for $N$ bodies leads to a numerical complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, which scales poorly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; &emsp; This report aims to analyse and implement two algorithms which attempt to reduce this complexity, the Barnes-Hut and fast multipole method (FMM) techniques, alongside the brute-force $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ approach, in order to compare their performances. For the sake of comparison, we will mainly base analysis around the simple 2D 'Coulomb gas', particles interacting under a logarithmic Coulombic potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; &emsp; The report begins with a section analysing the algorithms and their theoretical complexity, followed by a section describing their implementation, and finally a discussion section. We find, as expected from the literature, that FMM provides the biggest reduction in computational time for large systems, followed closely by the Barnes-Hut method. For smaller systems however (up to $10^3-10^4$ bodies) a simple vectorised naïve approach is the fastest, albeit with a high memory usage. "

It does this through hierarchical decomposition, in this case the use of tree data structures, specifically a quadtree in 2D. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.1 Tree Construction\n",

Each node, both internal and leaf nodes, contains information about the charge distribution (specifically the total charge and centre of charge) of the node. Formally, they are constructed by inserting particles into the data structure one after the other:\n",

Then, both particles are placed into their appropriate quadrants as above, which may require further subdivision if they end up in the same quadrant again.   \n"

    "##### 1.2.2 Force Calculation\n",
    "To calculate forces, the tree is recursively traversed from the root for each particle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the node is a leaf node and contains a particle that is not itself, then the force is calculated in the usual way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the node is an internal node, the ratio: $$\\frac{\\text{size of node in space (i.e. side length of the cube)}}{\\text{distance from particle to centre of charge of node}} \\equiv \\frac{s}{d} $$ is calculated. If this is less than a threshold value $\\theta$ (usually taken to be $\\sim$ 1), then the node is seen to contain particles that are closely packed and far away, and as a result can be treated as one single particle, ignoring its children nodes. The force on the particle is calculated in the usual way, using the centre of charge position and total charge of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If $s/d > \\theta$, the process recursively continues for each of the children of the node, until reaching the leaf node or a node which satisfies the above condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forces are then summed to give an overall acceleration for the particle. It is clear to see that $\\theta$ determines the accuracy of the simulation: a larger $\\theta$ leads to fewer calculations but a more approximate solution, whilst a smaller $\\theta$ may take longer but provide a more reliable solution. In the limit $\\theta\\rightarrow0$ the algorithm reduces to the brute-force approach, since no clusters are grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.3 Complexity\n",
    "For a _balanced_ quadtree with $h$ levels, the bottom level has $4^h$ nodes. Therefore:\n",
    "$$ 4^h \\geq N \\Rightarrow h \\sim \\log_4 N = \\frac{\\log_2 N}{\\log_2 4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2 N \\text{ or } \\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$$\n",
    "Insertion of each of the $N$ particles requires travelling the $h$ levels of the tree from root to leaf, therefore the overall complexity of constructing a quadtree is given by $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of the force calculation step is more complicated. A typical reasoning (as laid out in the original paper) follows as such: again assuming a balanced quadtree (i.e. homogoneously distributed charge), consider quadrupling the number of particles. This is equivalent to adjoining 3 root nodes to the existing one. To calculate the force on a particle situated in the 'original tree', these additional particles will contribute a fixed number of extra calculations, which is a function of $\\theta$ but not $N$. To imagine this, consider $\\theta \\gg 1$: this will simply add 3 force calculations, since the centre of charge of all three of the the 'additional root nodes' are far enough away, and they can be treated as a single particle. Reducing $\\theta$ to more reasonable values will increase the number of children of these 'additional nodes' that need to be explored, but assuming $N$ is large enough (and this further exploration is therefore not reaching leaf nodes), then the number of additional calculations does not depend on $N$. Since the number of force calculations is increasing by an additive constant (a function of $\\theta$) whilst $N$ is increasing by a multiplicative factor, the complexity goes as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ for a single particle, or $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ for $N$ particles. \n",

    "The FMM algorithm was introduced by Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin Jr. in the 1980s [2]. It uses similar hierarchical decomposition methods as the Barnes-Hut algorithm, but instead works with more accurate local and multipole expansions of the potential rather than simple information on the centre of charge of a node. Re-use of computation by traversing the tree in both directions allows complexity to be reduced to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ for arbitrary precision. For the sake of this report, detailed derivation of the maths and convergence properties will not be carried out: see the original paper for more detailed discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "A high-level overview of the algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A quadtree is constructed as in the Barnes-Hut method, however the approach need not be as rigorous, since the algorithm simply requires leaf nodes to house a small, constant $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of bodies.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. At the bottom leaf level, direct pair-wise interractions are calculated with nearest neigbours - since in step 1. we ensured each leaf node had a small number of bodies, this is inexpensive.\n",

Since we are essentially aggregating (summing) over the charges, this step is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. Going up the tree, the expansion of each node can be formed through aggregating the expansion of its children, using the M2M translation and summing. Again, since this is simply an aggregation over the charges, the whole upwards pass is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working downards from the top of the tree, we calculate the local (Taylor) expansion of the potential experienced at each node. Firstly, the local expansion of the parent node (if it exists) is shifted to the centre of the new node using an L2L translation. Then, the multipole expansion of non-adjacent (far away) nodes is translated into a local expansion at the location of the node, using M2L translation. In 2D, this can only ever be less than 27 interactions, independent of $N$, (see Figure X) and therefore is a constant amount of work. Finally, upon reaching the bottom leaf level, we calculate the direct contributions from the few remaining bodies, which is not computationally expensive since there are a small number of bodies at this level. Overall, the work done in the downard pass is constant for each body, and thefore $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ overall. "

    "### _3.1 Accuracy (conservation of energy, linear momentum and angular momentum)_\n",
    "As discussed, the naive and FMM approaches have the capacity to perfectly conserve energy. For an FMM implementation of high expansion order, we can have a highly accurate solution that still scales linearly, and is therefore faster than the naive approach. The difficult with the Barnes-Hut method is that, although increasing $\\theta$ allows us to speed up the computation, we also lose accuracy. It is also important to note that the naive approach by definition conserves momentum, since we include in our code a sum which ensures no double counting, and simply applies Newton's third law to give the two bodies involved an equal and opposite force (see Section 2.1.3). The same is not naturally true for BH and FMM methods. \n",

    "##### 3.2.1 Different Problems and 3D\n",
    "Extending the 2D simulation to 3D is very simple for the naive and BH approaches, the latter simply requiring the construction of an octree rather than a quadtree, whilst all the logic stays the same. For FMM however, the algorithm becomes much more complicated for a variety of reasons. To name a few: the 3D expansion now comes in the form of spherical harmonics, and for order $p$ there are $(p+1)^2$ coefficients; translations require the evaluation of non-trivial recurrence relations and complex coupling matrices; and interaction sets can be far larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current implementation, the BH approach uses an adaptive quadtree, whilst for simplicity our FMM uss a symmetric one. This means that our BH approach is better at dealing with non-uniform particle distributions. This is not an inherent difference between the algorithms, however: an avenue for further work would be to introduce an adaptive quadtree to our FMM implementation (although this is not trivial since care must be taken with the interraction list in an asymmetric tree). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2.2 Vectorisation\n",
    "The code in this report is meant to be a clear and intuitive implementation of the algorithms: in reality, they can be made a lot faster. A first simple way is to vectorise the Python loops using NumPy array broadcasting. This is very simple to implement for the naive approach (see source/naive/simulation.py), and at the cost of a large memory increase (from allocating the $N\\times N$ arrays), greatly speeds up computation:"

    "### _3.4 Conclusion_\n",
    "Overall, the three models have their advantages and disadvantages in certain situations. A key factor in deciding which model to use should also be their difficulty of implementation: although FMM provides good energy conservation, complexity scaling and can be applied to a whole host of problems, it is by far the most complicated to implement. Various libraries do exist (fmmlib2d, fmmlib3d etc.) but due to the complexity of the problem are often writen in Fortran and are not particularly accessible and adaptable to a desired problem. Meanwhile, a BH approach is far simpler to implement, can provide a reasonable solution, and in this case scales similarly to FMM. Although often quick to be neglected for the other algorithms, for medium-sized simulations (up to $10^3-10^4$), a simple vectorised brute-force approach can provide an accurate and comparable if not faster solution.   \n",
