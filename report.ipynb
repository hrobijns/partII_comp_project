Note also that the force between two bodies diverges as they get close to each other: this requires the inclusion of a softening parameter $\\epsilon$ which will be discussed further in section X."

Each node, both internal and leaf nodes, contains information about the total mass and centre of mass position of the node. Formally, they are construced by inserting bodies into the data structure one after the other:\n",

Then, place both bodies into their appropriate octants as above, which may require further subdivision if they end up in the same octant again.   \n"
